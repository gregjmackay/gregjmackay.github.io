As part of their Easter campaign, New World Supermarket requested a Facebook video post to increase brand engagement through a fun Easter Egg Hunt where users comment on a Facebook video to win Easter egg prizes. 

The post which lasted around a week ended up with 5000 entries, 900 likes and 120 shares, making it the most engaged Easter-related post (as of 2020). Considering the low-cost production - a half-day turn-around the <abbr title="Return on Investment">ROI</abbr> and engagement with this campaign were an eggcellent success.
