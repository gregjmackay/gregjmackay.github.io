ZenPlus approached me to audit and redesign their UX/UI, focusing on their navigation menus which had several severe UX issues. Using my experience backed by a recent [Baymard UX Certification](https://baymard.com/certified/d16a) I audited and redesigned navigation menus and other associated parts of the user experience.

From the presentation of category and taxonomy data to product filters, footer navigation and product pages I proposed the redesign of 20+ UI elements and 15 further Category/Taxonomy suggestions for the future as an ongoing improvement project for their Japanese e-commerce service.
