Maybelline wanted to make finding the perfect foundation easy. So the Love Your Face campaign was created - an interactive pick-a-path video, featuring influential Kiwi makeup vloggers helping women choose the best foundation for their skin type. 

During the testing, I discovered typical on-screen annotations weren’t going to work on mobile - the device on which over half our audience was likely to view the video. So we worked closely with Google to deliver the campaign using ‘cards‘ functionality (at the time a New Zealand first) to optimise the YouTube annotations for these users. 

To date, the video has had over 22,000 views, which amounts to almost 100,000 total minutes of engagement with the campaign. Along with the video, a strong visual identity was created that was used across print, social media, in–store <abbr>POS</abbr> and activation - all of which helped to nab a [bronze award at the 2015 <abbr>NZDM</abbr> Awards](https://web.archive.org/web/20210217113127/https://nzdmawards.co.nz/winnerscat/maybelline-new-york-love-your-face/).
