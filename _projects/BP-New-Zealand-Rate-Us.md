<abbr>BP</abbr> New Zealand wanted a fun and innovative way for customers to review their in-store experience when visiting petrol stations around New Zealand. 

Users stepped through a series of 5 questions and on entering a unique code from their receipt, went in the draw to win one of 5 $100 <abbr>BP</abbr> gift cards. Utilising existing branding, I used a speedometer visual with javascript slider functionality to enable the user to rate the relevant service. I designed and coded the website from start to finish.
