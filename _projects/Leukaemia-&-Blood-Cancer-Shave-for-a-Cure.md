Shave for a Cure is Leukaemia & Blood Cancer (<abbr>LBC</abbr>) New Zealandâ€™s Signature Fundraising Event. 

Every year volunteers shave their heads to help fund research and provide vital care and resources for the 2,500 people affected that <abbr>LBC</abbr> works with every year. 

I designed and coded an advertising banner that linked dynamically to the <abbr>LBC</abbr> signup database and showed real-time numbers of the remaining shavees needed for the 2500 shavee target. Around 2000 people shaved their heads, raising 1.4 million dollars.
