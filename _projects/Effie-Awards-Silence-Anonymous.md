The Effie Awards are known by advertisers and agencies globally as the pre-eminent award in the industry and recognise any and all forms of marketing that contribute to a brand’s success. 

In collaboration with art directors, I came up with an interactive idea for both the email campaign and landing page through animated gifs and interactive scroll utilising javascript and CSS to illustrate the campaign’s theme, “silence anonymous” - speaking to the power of the Effie to silence critics.
