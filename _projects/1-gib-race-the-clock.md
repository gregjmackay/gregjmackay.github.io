As part of an awareness campaign for <abbr title="Gibraltar Board">GIB</abbr>, New Zealand’s largest manufacturer and supplier of plasterboard and drywall systems requested a simple and engaging competition website to create a broader awareness of <abbr>GIB</abbr>’s delivery services.

Customers raced a ‘money clock’ counting down from a potential 5000-dollar prize, stopping once all the correct answers were inputted. I took the PSD designs from a sister company and built and developed the site in <abbr>PHP</abbr> and Javascript connecting to an internal <abbr>SQL</abbr> database.
