Mazda New Zealand required a Youtube Expanding Masthead placement for their campaign advertising the launch of the all-new Mazda MX-5. 

I completed the whole process from start to finish, from design and build in Google Web Designer, followed by trafficking through Google Studio (Formerly DoubleClick Studio) to the client’s media company.
