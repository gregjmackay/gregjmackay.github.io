**A complete case study for this project can be provided on request.**

ZenMarket requested an overhaul of their transactional email design for their Japanese proxy eccomerce service which ships to over 100 countries in 17-plus languages.

This began with an audit of the user flow and design of over 30 emails triggered at different points along the shopping journey. In addition, I documented the other touchpoints including browser push, app dashboard and messages notifications.

I proposed a new design based on internal and user feedback, and the addition of 7 extra emails where I saw gaps in the journey from purchase to delivery. In total 40 separate emails were designed, coded and eventually translated into 17-plus languages.

Language managers entered data into Google Sheets and <abbr>JSON</abbr> data was automated to create the <abbr>HTML</abbr> for around 650 individual templates. These templates were eventually uploaded to the client’s email marketing software.
