title: About
subtitle: <p>From a young age I was captured by the endless potential design has to breathe new ideas into life â€“ to make the mundane beautiful, the wild-idea plausible, the frustrating enjoyable.<p/><p>Developing a solid technical background over the past 10 years, while not losing the same sense of curiosity I began with, has led to growth and success at various digital, web and advertising agencies in New Zealand and Japan.<p/><p>When not in the office, that same desire to create and discover sees me pursue interests in language, music, sport and the great outdoors.<p/>
